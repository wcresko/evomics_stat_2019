# Content for CK lectures
below are the contents for each lecture.
-----

- Penultimate 1a
		- Overview of R and scripting-based analyses
		-R is for statistics! Good at stats processes and all the packages available! Derived from S.
		-Some examples of cool plots [plotly, ggplot]
		-Rstudio- front-end, nice for beginners, can open .r or .rmd files in there [explore R studio section in separate Rmd]
		-Functionality and Rmd- show 'raw' script and putting the code into context- then show that lecture is an Rmd file too!
		-Also a variety of outputs and ways to report!
		-Intro to basic functions- calulator, creating objects and variables, vectors, creating a dataframe, data structures.
		-Importing data: need sample dataset- stickleback?
	-Descriptive statistics- mean/var/etc, 
	-Basic data visualization- plotting
	-Sample from normal distribution/randomization/etc
	[20mins lec/ 40mins work]
	----	
	-Think more about the dataset w/ stickleback data
		-Different types of data- must be assigned in R
		-Data structure- Bill's figures
		-Observatrions, replicates, etc
		-True for all data, then this is how R interprets it!
	-Indexing and subsetting to subset out from really complex datasets!
		-[] and $
	-Tidyverse!
		-Variable manipulation
		-Exercises form Bill's slides
		-tibble/subsetting/manipulate
	----
	-ggplot and plotly!
	-show and tell
	-provide a LARGE dataset
	-replicate the plots using ggplot

- 1a. Rintro-as is
	- Goals and why we need stats
	- stickleback example (need to add slide of data table)
	- rules for setting up datasets and doing repeatalbe work (plug for Rmarkdown and Github)
	- Basics of R (creating objects, distributions, random samples)
	- Data visualization (plot and hist)
	- Creating, reading in, and exporting dataframes
	- Indexing dataframes
	- Hands-on RNAseq data to apply functions learned
	-------------
	-Data wrangling and EDA
	- Intro to Tidyverse
	- Example of tibble
	- vector/data types
	- functions in dplyr
	- Tidyverse.R script (needs to be added- not yet in repo)
	-------------
	- Git and Github
	- Intro to commands
	- Setup account
	- clone our repository (need to change the web address to correct repo) 

- 1b. Scott's version of Rintro
	-More upfront intro to R and resources (pull some of these?)
	- Basic functionality- overlaps with above
	- Basic manipulation (pull some of this?)
	- Basic visualization0 overlaps with above
	- Overview of more advanced applications (perhaps worth mentioning?)
	- Tidyverse
	- dplyr (overlaps with above)
	- Intro to Rmarkdown (pull this over for other lecture?)
	- Then a pretty comprehensive tutorial online for ggplot (Do we want to add this???)


- 2. Documenting and reproducing genomics research (Scott's recommendations, below)
	- What is markdown??? Types with commonality
	-Write md that makes a formatted list (Bill's lec)
	- R Markdown
	 - Effective use of Chunks
	 - Setting up an effective R Project [skip]
	 - Knitting for report production
	 - Sharing/Publishing (RPubs, shiny)
	 - (maybe, possibly just a quick demo?) FlexDashboards 
	- GitHub (integrated with RStudio)
	 - Editing GitHub Pages
	 - GitHub Additions (wiki, GitHub pages, etc.)
